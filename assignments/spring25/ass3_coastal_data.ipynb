    "### As part of material for OCES 3301 \"Data Analysis in Ocean Sciences\" delivered at HKUST\n",

    "### General spiel about assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "***Your hand in should be in the form of a Jupyter notebook and associated files (if any), and no other form of hand-ins will be accepted***. The use of Jupyter notebook and its Python component is part of the assessment criteria for the *presentation* and *coding* portion. Hand these in through Canvas in the usual way. You are graded on the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **scientific content** (40%)\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **writing, presentation and referencing** (30%)\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **use of Jupyter and/or Python coding** (30%)\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **orginality** (10%; analysis beyond scope of course, use of memes and puns; surprise me)\n",
    "\n",
    "See the samples assignments I've made for the kind of things we might be expecting. We will probably be fairly loose with giving credit, but 60% or below would count as unsatisfactory (85% or above would be an A grade I would imagine).\n",
    "\n",
    "You are allowed to use other Python packages if you find them, but see point b) below.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) ***Late assignments get a penalty of 1% of full marks per minute*** (so don't bother handing in anything after 2 hours). We will still mark it and give feedback, but you just don't get the credit. Excuses could be entertained but you will need sufficient evidence to back this up (e.g. your internet went down in the area and you have some pictorial/written demosntration for this).\n",
    "\n",
    "b) ***Your code needs to be able to run from scratch at least in the standard Google Colab***, otherwise you will get no marks from the 3rd attribute, and probably next to nothing in the 1st attribute (because your graphs probably won't be generating). When you hand the notebooks in, you should pass it through `Kernel -> Restarts & Clear Output`, so the file is reasonably sized and only full of text (and if you don't *you get a 10% penalty* for not following instructions, for reasons in point c) below). The procedure here is that we will run the whole notebook from scratch probably on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com), then mark the resulting outputs. **So make sure you test your code through Google Colab at least!** (or do your assignments on there, find whatever work flow that works for you).\n",
    "\n",
    "c) ***Plagiarism***: By all means consult each other and/or work together, but the files you hand in should be done and written up separately. For allowing checks in Turnitin, you should pass it through `Kernel -> Restarts & Clear Output` before you hand it in. **The default for anyone accused with plagiarism is ZERO on the assignment**, and depending on whether you decide to contest and the result of the appeal, possibly lead to an official note of plagiarism on your transcript (I will allow people to argue but one should be ready for the consequences). \n",
    "\n",
    "A few things count as plagiarism:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Copying between students, and the default is that ALL parties involved get zero for the assignment**, regardless of whether the side can demonstrate they were copied from (extra incentive to keep the writing separate).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Copying text without citation is plagiarism**. Use quotation marks and give reference if you are directly lifting text, but don't do this too often (and will result in text looking cluttered, and not getting full credit for the *presentation* aspect).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code is a slightly more grey area**, but I will just say no one has ever really been punished for being cautious and generous with citations, but make sure you present it well (e.g. overburdening text with citations will make the presentation ugly, and will not get full credit for the *presentation* aspect say).\n",
    "\n",
    "I will just make the point that we don't tend to accuse plagiarism unless we have enough proof, and if we are doing it it probably means we think we have a sufficiently strong case that is probably not worth arguing against (because then penalty then gets increased)."

    "# Assessment 3 (25% of total course grade)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this you are to analyse contents from `marine_station_data_[123].csv`, which is some data sampled from a region in Asia that I am deliberately being non-specific about. The data contains the kind of things you would normally expect from data collected from a coastal marine station, and is not unlike the one you saw in assignment 2. The [book by Jorge Sarmiento and Niki Gruber](https://lbdiscover.ust.hk/bib/991012846667203412) (online access available for HKUST members, and there are also copies available in the library) is probably also an excellent reference for the ocean biogeochemistry variables that will show up here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pandas code below reads the data, and you should treat these primarily as time-series data and perform analyse on it. The data is nice in that the dates are sensible and the columns are labelled with units etc., but there are some subtleties you will want to be careful of (some of these are highlighted in the possible avenues of investigation below).\n",
    "\n",
    "A few things to try and investigate using tools and techniques you already have at your disposal:\n",
    "\n",
    "* See how stations `1` `2` and `3` are similar/different to each other.\n",
    "* There are some columns with `NaN`s floating around, probably should do something about those.\n",
    "* There are other subtle things you might need to deal with. For example, if you try and do `df[\"Chlorophyll-a (μg/L)\"].plot()` it will fail with the error `no numeric data to plot`. Have a see why is going on (hint: try opening the file itself, or get python to spit out what is in the column). This happens for multiple columns. Deal with these in Python itself, rather than modifying the file (because the end product of this assignment requires you to load data from fresh remotely anyway).\n",
    "* When analysing temperature, see if there is in fact a global warming trend, because the data is over a sufficiently long period. If you compute a PSD for temperature you may or may not want to remove the global warming trend.\n",
    "* What are the seasonal cycles like? Is there a distinct shift in the seasonal characteristics over the years? (e.g. stronger hypoxia? water getting more fresh/saline in certain seasons?) Do this visually first, and then consider doing statistical tests (cf. `05/06_statistical_tests`).\n",
    "* Are there strong correlations (or anti-correlation, lag correlation etc) between the different data sets? (cf. `07_time_series`)\n",
    "* If there are strong correlations between two variables A and B say, try and create a model that uses A to predict B or vice-versa (cf. `03/04_regression`; e.g. Chlorophyll concentration might be something we might want to predict from other variables such as temperature and nitrogen).\n",
    "* Instead of doing some/all of the things above at one station, what about comparing data at different stations? (The only thing I will tell you is that all stations are relatively close to each other.)\n",
    "* Other things you can think of...\n",
    "\n",
    "You could for example choose to focus more on the physical variables such as temperature, salinity, and pH, or if you think the chemical things are more important then maybe oxygen, pH and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), or if you think the biology is more important then maybe chlorophyll, nitrates and phosphorus, or some combination thereof. There is quite a lot of freedom here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things you should do here (and the intention behind the tasks):\n",
    "\n",
    "a) some background research into plausible mechanisms that can influence the variables, formulating plausible hypotheses [*be able to do some background research*]\n",
    "\n",
    "b) explore some variables and demonstrate understanding of the time-series tools, to explore the plausible hypotheses [*practise and demonstrate understanding of tools and Python code*]\n",
    "\n",
    "c) write some of these things up and describe them using the Markdown cells [*practise and demonstrate understanding of Jupyter notebooks*]\n",
    "\n",
    "d) any others that could fall under originality (memes welcome, references to Miffy even better, but scientific content should always come first)"
