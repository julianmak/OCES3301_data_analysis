Beyond linear regression, we can fit quadratics, cubics etc., with increasing the number of coefficients.\n",

We also see here that the three species of penguins do form clusters, with the gentoo data noticeably different from the other two, and the other two have some overlap. \n",

Not going to do this here unless you want a challenge (see below for suggested exercise).\n",
