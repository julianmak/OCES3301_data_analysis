From a units points of view, since the rate of oxygen consumption has units (say) $\\mathrm{mol} / \\mathrm{rm}$, and oxygen content has units $\\mathrm{mol}$, then you want to multiply the former by time somehow to make the units agree: computing the area under the curve $y(t)$ effectively does that, and computing the area under the curve is basically doing an integral.\n",
