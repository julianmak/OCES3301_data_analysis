One simple thing to do is to force the contours with the `levels` optional argument.

The water can be below zero degrees in the ocean because there is salinity, so the water is not necessarily freezing (it is *freshwater* that freezes at zero degrees, and that is also assuming we are at sensible pressures). The extrusion of sorts of the 2 degree isotherm from the Southern Ocean particularly at depth indicates there is some export of particularly cold and dense water from the South towards the North in the abyssal ocean; this is usually attributed to the AABW (Antarctic Bottom Water).\n",

These are part of the overturning circulation, and are normally associated with the NADW (North Atlantic Deep Water) and the AAIW (Antarctic Intermediate Water).
