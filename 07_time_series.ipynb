    "\n",
    "[**Window functions**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_function) are really intended to be used to modify a signal to force it to be periodic, so that you can do Fourier analysis on it; see *08_time_series*. While they are not designed as kernels functions, there is no particularly reason you can't use them as kernel functions for filtering. Two exercises to try here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Choose a window (`signal.tukey` is as good a choice as any), look up the syntax and plot out the window function. What you then want to do is to normalise the kernel function so that the integral of the window function is 1 (hint: you probably want `np.trapz` somewhere to do the integral). Then, one option is to multiply the kernel function by the window size, multiply that scaled kernel function to a uniformly spaced signal, then compute the mean as in the filtering cases above to give you a value of the filtered function at some $t$. Because you multiply the intended kernel function by window size and then compute the mean of the product, you are preserving the magnitude of the function somewhat (if you miss one of these steps then the result will either be too large or too small). Try different choices of window sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Try other functions available in `scipy.signal` and see if there are any significant differences. Some of these windows have parameters associated with them (e.g. `signal.tukey` has an optional `alpha` parameter), look and see what differences those make too.\n",
