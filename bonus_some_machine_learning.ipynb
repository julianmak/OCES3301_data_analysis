    "[Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) has found a ton of applications in multiple disciplines, notably in:\n",
    "\n",
    "* image and facial recognition\n",
    "* natural language processing (e.g. predictive text, translations)\n",
    "* classical literature (e.g. [Kuzushiji](https://nips2018creativity.github.io/doc/deep_learning_for_classical_japanese_literature.pdf))\n",
    "* self-driving cars (e.g. [HKUST efforts](https://seng.hkust.edu.hk/news/20200402/autonomous-vehicles-developed-hkust-engineering-professor-serve-community-during-covid-19-outbreak-mainland-china))\n",
    "* Artificial Intelligence (e.g. the famous [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo))\n",
    "\n",
    "There has also been applications in multiple aspects of environmental sciences, including oceanography. In this notebook we are going to briefly touch on the more elementary applications. The focus here will be on demonstrating some use of machine learning and the relevant Python syntax, and less on the understanding of the algorithms themselves (they can get quite technical and mathematical). The explanations do exist, but we will largely use them like a *black box*, and just assume we have made some deal/sacrifice with say [Hermaeus Mora](https://elderscrolls.fandom.com/wiki/Hermaeus_Mora) in exchange for some answers.\n",

    "> NOTE: Again, these algorithm are just tools, and they have their own limitations, and should not be regarded as silver bullets that will solve all your problems. One criticism I have with these things is that these tools can work really well, but you might not understand why they work so well, and that is something that generally makes me a little uneasy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning can briefly be split into **unsupervised** and **supervised** learning. Unsupervised is when you let the algorithms find features for you, while supervised is when the data itself is already tagged, and a model is *trained up* to try and reproduce the target data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sounds familiar? Because you've seen at least one example in this course already! PCA would be an example of unsupervised learning, where you feed in the data, and the algorithm returns features that capture certain amounts of variance. Linear regression would be an example of supervised learning I guess, where given some outputs and inputs, you want to find some sort of model that minimises the mismatch between outputs and predictions using inputs.

There are increasing interest in [BGC-Argo](https://biogeochemical-argo.org/) that measure quantities relevant to biogeochemistry, and [deep Argo](https://argo.ucsd.edu/expansion/deep-argo-mission/) that go down to 4000 m.\n",

In the argo data of interest to us here, we know from theory and observations already that different water masses clusters in a different way, so can machine learning pick those out for us? In the case below, we are going demonstrate the use of the **$k$-means** algorithm, which is one possible way of identifying clusters. $k$-means very loosely considers partitions of the data, computing the means of the data associated with each partition, and iterating on the choice of partition such that there is a minimisation of the deviations of the partitioned data from the means. The algorithm is available in `scikit-learn`, with syntax demonstrated below.\n",
