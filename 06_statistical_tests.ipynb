    "Basically more of the same as last time, but less talk and more code, and with different statistical tests and data. We will be going through the sea cucumber and the dice example before focusing on the iris example (because my cooked up multivariate data is not very good with doing $F$-tests on). The exercise just gets you to try and do similar things but for the penguin data.\n",

    "\n",
    "1) You formulate the null hypothesis to be the opposite of what you want to try and show, choose test based on question and other assumptions about the data, choose significance, do test, and based on analysis either REJECT null hypothesis if $p$-value is small or your test statistic is big compared to the threshold, or FAIL TO REJECT null hypothesis otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) You never try and proof the null hypothesis, you only ever fail to reject it.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The $p$-value is not the probability whether the null/alternative hypothesis is true or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) $p$-value small by itself doesn't mean anything, and it also does not mean result is of practical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) The choice of $\\alpha=0.05$ is purely a convention, and the observation is that unlikely event happens almost surely with large samples, so if you run enough tests you will almost surely to get a hit (do not for God sake torture the data until it confesses, this is incredibly bad practice).\n",
    "\n",
    "6) $p$-value being below the threshold does not mean the null hypothesis is correct, it really just means there is not enough statistical evidence to say anything, nothing more.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) $\\alpha$ sets your Type I errors of false positives, while $\\beta$ relates to the power of your test and is the Type II error of false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) The analysis part is just one step, and if anything your experimental design and/or the question you ask is more important, so check that too \n",

The test statistic of interest (usually called the $F$-value, after Ronald Fisher) is a ratio of the two, and large $F$-value means the variation between groups dominates the variance within the groups.

One way to think of $H$ is the amount of **surprise** or **information** you get from doing a random sample from the dataset: $H=0$ is no surprise and perfect information (because there is only one species so you know exactly what you should get from a random draw), while high $H$ means the converse. The example below computes this for the Iris data based on `variety` using mostly `Pandas` commands.\n",

The answer here should be `log 3` because the Iris dataset has 50 entries of each species."
