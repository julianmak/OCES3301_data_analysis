    "***Given a control group and a test group, where you do something only to the test group, what effect does it have, and is it significant?*** This kind of question shows up frequently, such as in drug treatments, dietary studies, life and population sciences (e.g. how do phytoplankton response to external stimuli such as light), studies of cursedness in animals, and many other scientific fields. While there are plausible reasons to explain certain phenomena (e.g. cursedness of animal enabled by cameras), there are also unknowns that sometimes we do not or cannot account for (e.g. cursedness is in the eye of the beholder). Different people might rate cursedness of the following slightly differently.\n",

    "The problem here is that there is always spread in the data (codified by the **pdf**; see later) and **noise** (or stochasticity), so that makes the experimental and/or observation results fuzzy, and we want ways to pick out the real effects and be confident that we are not making conclusions of the noise. These kind of issues occur even if some of the questions could be answered deterministically in some sense (e.g. observing gravitational waves or the Higgs boson, which have been predicted to exist from theoretical considerations). The below content gives a rather condensed overview of this."

    "## Disclaimer + some personal experiences with statistical testing\n",
    "\n",
    "I find the statistical testing stuff ***HARD***, not so much the technical aspect, but certainly the ***conceptual*** ones. I have personally tried to learn this stuff in a dedicated maybe three times since school, first as a A-level student during the final years of secondary school (this kind of stuff was standard in the then statistics modules), somewhat during my undergrad degree (one practice course, but really the more pure side of probability theory), and then for preparing this course through self-study. Instead of hating this stuff, now I at least tolerate it, though I will not say I find the content particularly easy to present: these two notebooks on statistical testing probably took about the same time to write than the rest of the course put together.\n",
    "\n",
    "For me personally, I think I found the statistical things hard because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) For a long time I could not see how the procedures I get taught links up with the problems the procedures are supposed to tackle.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) I couldn't see what could could go wrong if you didn't follow the recipe, and if you go wrong how do you go about fixing it (I have to say I was somewhat taught through the *\"follow the recipe, don't think about it and everything will be alright\"* mantra, which I have tried very hard to push against in writing this course).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) I didn't have enough practice with it (since I don't really use this stuff in my work).\n",
    "\n",
    "All three factors of course multiply each other: I couldn't see why we were doing it, I didn't know when I went wrong, and I didn't have enough practice (or the need to do so) to begin to see why it needs to be done in a certain way, and the symptoms of when it goes wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "A turning point for me is was when I had to prepare for this course and went through [David Speigelhalter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Spiegelhalter)'s book [\"The Art of Statistics\"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43722897-the-art-of-statistics). Beyond it being actually quite an entertaining read (because the case studies are actually really interesting, and I am being completely serious here!), the layout of that book really does try to pose the problems first, attack it with the tools, and highlight on the way why it matters certain things are done a certain way.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course is not a statistics course, and I am not trying to be reproduce the things that are already in excellent books (see some of the ones recommended in this course). The thing I will aim to try and do is to link *concepts* to *practice* (in this case with code right next to the descriptive text), dispense with a lot of the formalism and rigour (I hope I haven't overdone it), and I will do my best to highlight the *banana skins*, i.e. where you can go wrong, and what happens if you do.\n",

    "## Technical disclaimers\n",
    "\n",
    "1) I am going to use some probability theory to talk about things, with appropriate refreshers if you have not seen these before. There will be complicated looking integrals involved, but the main thing to bear in mind is that most of those integrals are going to be evaluated numerically, enabled by the `scipy.stat` packages, and in the end you only care about one or two numbers that result.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Since probability is involved, there really should be some discussion about the **frequentist** and **Bayesian** viewpoint, which does affect the interpretation, but there won't be. Just be aware there is that rather subtle but important banana skin lying around. The discussion and interpretations below will take the *frequentist* viewpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "> NOTE: I personally favour the *Bayesian* viewpoint and find it much more intuitive and satisfactory (maybe because then I can rely on mathematical equations much more readily to think about things).\n",
    "\n",
    "3) When I get to hypothesis testing, there is the debate of whether one should use the [Fisher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher) or the [Pearson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egon_Pearson)-[Neyman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerzy_Neyman) formulation. I am going to use mix-and-match in the presentation below (which I gather is now standard practice), and I am not going to be explicit of what bits I am using are from where, because I think it convolutes the arguments somewhat. Look this up on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing) if you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) While a lot of focus is traditionally on the analysis part of the hypotheses testing, in fact the **experimental design** and what kind of questions you set up for yourself really is much more important: no matter how much of a analysis wizard you can be, if the experiment was poorly designed in the first place you are probably dead from the onset. The designed aspect is also one very big and important banana skin that we are not really going to touch on below, but you should absolutely be aware of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) I am only going to focus on four tests (Z-test, $t$-test, $F$-test, and $\\chi^2$ test). There are many others, each with their own assumptions, but these ones illustrate a lot of the common points and pitfalls, and if you know how these things work in principle you can extend accordingly (on the assumption that the principles were learnt well). The thing you should bear in mind is to choose the test according to the assumptions. The thing ***you should absolutely not do*** is to keep trying different tests on the same data until you get the result you want. ***DON'T DO IT***: this is akin to torturing the data until it confesses, it is extremely bad practice, and probably the issue is more likely to be because of experimental design or the hypothesis being tested."

    "With that in mind, lets start with some terminology so we can use it to set the scene. The **probability** $p$ of an event $X$ is, loosely speaking, a number that is assigned to the likelihood of the event happening. By convention $p$ is some real number between and including 0 and 1, with $p(X)=1$ denoting something will certainly happen, while $p(X)=0$ means something will never happen. The probability of all possible events should add up to 1.\n",

Suppose 1000 hypothesis are made, with confidence level of 95% and power of 80% (so $\\alpha=0.05$ and $\\beta=0.20$). Suppose also that only 10% of the null hypothesis are actually false.

From this, conclude that the above choice of parameters result in 125 reported discoveries, of which 45 of these are false-positives, i.e. 36% of the reported discoveries are dud discoveries, rather than the 5% you might expect from $\\alpha=0.05$ (that's what I mean above when I say it's actually worse).\n",
