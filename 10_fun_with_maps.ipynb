While the data I've provided are in regular lon/lat grids so there is no strong need to use map projections, I do not provide masks or the like to plot land with, so it might be advantageous to have a package that can plot land features, coastlines and the like. You might want to focus on the poles, which the regular lon/lat projection will not be that sensible (because you are really trying to represent a disk as a cylinder, which involves a tear). There might be times when you want certain properties that simply cannot be represented in the regular lon/lat projection: for example, the area is not preserved, so giving rise to the problem that things at the equator look much smaller than they are than at the poles (e.g. Indian looks much smaller than Greenland, when actually the area is actually 1.5 times larger).\n","\n","Before we get to the `cartopy` package that does most of the heavy lifting for us, just a bit of (probably) useful mathematical background."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ANSy8w5_PqBt"},"source":["## Classical geometry (with some topology)\n","\n","Recall in `08_time_series` I floated the idea of a basis, where a vector can be represented in different ways (with the standard canonical basis $\\{\\boldsymbol{e}_1, \\boldsymbol{e}_2\\} = \\{(1, 0), (0, 1)\\}$, or some other way basis; see example in that notebook).

What this means is that the *topology* is fundamentally different (in this case through the Euler characteristic, which is related to the *Gaussian curvature* through the [Gauss-Bonnet theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauss%E2%80%93Bonnet_theorem); not going to elaborate on that).

For the EOF, what in generally do is to start with $f(t,x,y)$, reshape it into $f(t, \\mathrm{space})$, and generically the dimensions of $t$ and $\\mathrm{space}$ will not agree, and if we form the covariance matrix we would have to artificially bulk out locations with empty numbers to make sure the eventual covariance matrix is square.
